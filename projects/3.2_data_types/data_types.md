# Data Types
- Every value in rust is of a certain *data type*
- We will look at two data type subsets: **scalar** and **compound**

Note:
Rust is a *statically typed* language, which means that it must konw what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.

## Scalar
A *scalar* type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:
1. Integers,
2. Floating-point numbers,
3. Booleans,
3. characters

### Integer Types
An integer is a number without a factional component.

## Compound
