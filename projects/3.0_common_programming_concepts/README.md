# Common Programming Concepts

1. Variables
2. Basic Types
3. Functions
4. Comments
5. Control Flow

## Keywords
Rust uses *keywords* that are reserved for use by the language only. These words cannot be used as names of variables or functions.

`as` - perform primitive casting, disambiguate the specific trait containing an item or rename items in `use` statements
`async` - return a `Future` instead of blocking the current thread
`await` - suspend executing until the result of a `Future is ready
`break` - exit a loop immediately
`const` - define constant items or costant raw pointers
`continue` - continue to the next loop iteration
`crate` - in a module path, refers to the crate root
`dyn` - dynamic dispatch to a trait object
`else` - fall back for `if` and `if let` control flow constructs
`enum` - define an enumeration
`extern` - link an external function or variable
`false` - Boolean false literal
`fn` - define a function for the function pointer type
`for` - loop over items from an iterator, implementa  trait, or specify a higher-ranked lifetime.
`if` - branch based on the restul of a conditional expression
`impl` - implement inherent or trait functionality
`in` - part of `for` loop syntax
`let` - bind a variable
`loop` - loop unconditionally
`match` - match a value to patterns
`mod` - define a module
`move` - make a closure take ownersup of all its captures
`mut` - denote mutability in references, raw pointers, or pattern bindings
`pub` - denote public visibility in struct fields, `impl` blocks, or modules
`ref` - bind by reference
`return` - return from function
`Self` - a type alias for the type we are defining or implementing
`self` - method subject or current module
`static` - global variable or lifetime lasting the entire program execution
`struct` - define a structure
`super` - parent module of the current module
`trait` - define a trait
`true` - Boolean true literal
`type` - define a type alias or associated type
`union` - define a union; is only a keyword when used in a union declaration
`unsafe` - denote unsafe code, functions, traits, or implementations
`use` - bring symbols into scope
`where` - denote clauses that constrain a type
`while` - loop conditionally based o the result of an expression
