# Functions

**Define** function with `fn` followed by a function name and `()`

The function begins with `{` and ends with `}`

**Call** function with the function ame folowed by `()`

Functions can be **called** from inside the main function.

## Parameters

Parameters a special **variables** that are part of a function's signature. Whne a function has parameters, you can provide concrete values for those parameters. The concrete values are called *arguments*

In function signatures, you **must** declare the type of each parameter.

## Statements and Expressions

Function bodies comprise of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression.

Rust is an **expression-based language*, so it's important to understand this.

**Statements** are instructions that perform an action and **do not** return a value.

**Expressions** evaluate to a resulting value.

```rust

fn main(){main() {
    let y = 6;
}
```

This is a "main" function declaration containing one statement.

If we put a semi-colon after it makes it a statement.
If we don't put a semi-colon after it keeps it an expression.
