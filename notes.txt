	 - Integers, Floating-point numbers, Booleans, Characters

These are the different ways to specify the scalar types -

	Integers: 		i8, u8, i16, u16, i32, u32, i64, u64, i128, u128, isize, usize
	Floating-Points: 	f32, f64

Chapter 4 is about the most unique thing about Rust: the special ownership and borrowing paradigm that all Rust programs are bound by.

Chapter 5 is about Structs, which are unique and powerful data types that allow us to group a whole bunch of different things together. We also learn how to write methods on structs, as well as associated functions to those structs.

Chapter 6 is about enums, but I haven't finished this chapter so... I can't explain it.
